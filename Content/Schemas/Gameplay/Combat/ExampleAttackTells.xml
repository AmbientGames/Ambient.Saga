    EXAMPLE: Attack Tells for Combat Reaction System
    =================================================

    This shows how different creatures/enemies would have tells defined.
    Each tell has narrative preview text and defines outcomes for each defense reaction.

    The player sees: "The goblin crouches low, muscles tensing..."
    They choose: [DODGE] [BLOCK] [PARRY] [BRACE]
    Result varies based on choice vs optimal defense.
